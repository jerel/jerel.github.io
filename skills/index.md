### Things I specialize in

I love to build modern internet based applications and I especially enjoy maps and real time technology. I've written software that managed and searched millions of data points, software that shows users moving on a map with real time updates, and many other projects such as this blog platform you're now reading. From 2010 to 2014 I helped lead the PyroCMS project and am a huge supporter of open source software and communities.

Current browsers are now very capable platforms for software that can often out think and out maneuver the classic desktop application. I specialize in software that can be accessed from anywhere in the world that solves a unique problem or outperforms the alternative solution in some way. If you have an idea or problem that you'd like to talk about with me get in touch.
