I&#39;ve watched Matt Cutts set and achieve his [30 day challenges](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html) for a couple years now and I&#39;ve always thought that it would be a great thing to try myself.

#### The Plan

Today I'm going to bite the bullet and start my own 30 day challenge: **intense exercise for 30 minutes or more each and every day**. While I've thoroughly enjoyed mountain biking in the past it's always subject to my work schedule. Which is another way of saying "infrequent". It's happened before where I've woke up in the morning, sat down to write code and haven't got up until evening. We know that's not a healthy practice but... there's so many problems that need solved and all I have to do to solve them is rattle my keyboard. It's addictive.

I've been alive for well over 20 years now and I've seen a lot of months come and go. However I don't think I've ever done one thing every single day for 30 days in a row. Sure I'll work out 2 or 3 times a week but inevitably I miss a day or two. Then the next week it's even easier to skip another day. I want to create a habit that will make me healthier and clear my mind.

#### The Reward

My main reward is to feel better. I don't feel bad now but if I've been biking regularly I feel on top of the world. I would like a road bike too... we have beautiful winding roads to explore near my house. If I can prove to myself that I will use it regularly I may finally buy a nice road bike.
