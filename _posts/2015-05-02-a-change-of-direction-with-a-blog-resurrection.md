I&#39;m currently on the plane home from PeersConf where I listened to many excellent talks. Yitzchok Willroth&#39;s keynote in particular encouraged every attendee to &quot;cultivate for yourself a mentor; acquire for yourself a colleague&quot;. It followed that statement with the question: &quot;If not now, when?&quot;. I enjoy web development and I enjoy helping others rapidly learn something that I struggled to learn whether it be through IRC, blogging, pull requests, or speaking. Unfortunately for the past year+ I&#39;ve done very poorly at that.

This post is a short explanation and a public pledge to do better.

#### I'm Jerel and I'm a recovering developer

In 2010 I joined the PyroCMS core team and would help grow the project for the next 3+ years. Overall it was an amazing experience: I got to speak with customers and contributors from all over the world, visited conferences, and I also learned an uncomfortable amount about creating a self hosted PHP application that could survive in the ghetto of shared-hosting servers. There were many quiet, grateful users. There was the occasional angry user. There were commits that "broke the build" and early on I would happily stay up half the night to fix it and tag another release. Burning the candle on both ends with no firm business hours. Consequently once or twice I was called a genius or a machine, neither of which are remotely true. In my experience if someone appears to be a 10x contributor it's probably because they spend an unhealthy amount of time learning or working behind the scenes. I did, and I burned out.

Toward the end every time I got a notification from Github I felt a little stab of despair: there seems to be a rule that no matter how many issues you close on a popular project there will always be a hundred left. As I suppose is usually the case with burnout money was a factor. While PyroCMS was doing fairly well it couldn't pay me a full salary *and* I wasn't charging enough on my contract projects to properly make up the difference so each Github issue felt like a conflict between a healthy project and a healthy bank account.

In 2013 I was approached by Greg Aker about joining nGen Works as a contractor to write Python. I was quite reluctant as I considered myself a "PHP developer" at the time. Luckily he didn't give up and I enjoyed about 1.5 years with their team before their client landscape changed and they let their development team go. Unfortunately keeping up with the job and a couple existing personal projects kept me very busy and I quit writing/contributing. In early 2014 Ryan Thompson approached Phil Sturgeon and myself about buying PyroCMS as he still depended on it heavily and had big plans for it. We ended up working out a deal and he is now the sole owner of PyroCMS. I've heard it's nearing a v3.0 (based on Laravel).

#### Moving forward

Now that I'm doing contract work only I have some plans for new OSS community contributions. For one thing I've added a clause to my contracts that allows me to open source generic code that isn't part of the client's proprietary solution. Having that in place makes it much simpler to give back to the community.

I also am blocking out between half a day and a full day each week for writing and contributions. I consider it a crucial part of my growth as a developer + business and I don't want to routinely take evening time away from my family just to further my business. The alternative is to "fit it in some place" and based on my past performance that doesn't ever seem to happen.

Thanks for reading this far. I will be publishing a new blog post shortly about JavaScript applications, likely either a introductory topic or about starting with EmberJS. If you'd like to know when I publish it [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jerelunruh).
