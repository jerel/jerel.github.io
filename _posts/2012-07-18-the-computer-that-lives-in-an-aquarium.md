I needed a new computer and this time I decided to go with something a little less dull than the motherboard in a tin box... I knew that the guys at pugetsystems.com had put together a computer similar to this and it had ran without problems for a couple years. They had used the Eclipse System 6 (6 gallon) aquarium and I went with that too since an ATX motherboard fits perfectly along the back wall.

#### Time to show Newegg some love...

Here is my parts list:

* GA-EP43T-USB3 GIGABYTE motherboard (Pros: 10 usb ports and support for 16GB ram)
* 4GB (for now) of G.SKILL RAM 1600 DDR3
* 430 watt Thermaltake PSU. I hate picking power supplies. This one had good reviews so I ran with it.
* fanless video card with the NVIDIA GeForce 9400 GT chip and 512MB memory
* Intel Core 2 Duo E7400 Wolfdale 2.8GHz processor
* Western Digital 640GB 7200 RPM hard drive
* Two Acer 20" monitors
* 5 gallons of mineral oil from my local veterinary
* Ubuntu 10.04

Here are a few pictures of the build process:
